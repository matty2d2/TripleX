# TripleX
## A command line game in C++

In this game you are a secret agent trying to prove your skills as a master code breaker. Breaking the code involves finding numbers that both add up to a specific value and multiply to a specific value.

## Usage

First we need to compile the build.

```bash
cl triplex.cpp
```

Then we can simply, run the following to begin the game.

```bash
triplex
```

## Motivation

I built this game to get used to working with C++ and the syntax.
